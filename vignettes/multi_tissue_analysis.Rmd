In this vignette, we will analyze a gene expression dataset with samples from multiple tissues. We will highlight:


# Enrichment to Identify Tissue-Specific Changes

We will use data from BgeeDB normal-tissue expression. In research, we will typically want to compare normal to one or more treatment ro disease groups. Thus, consider the below comparison as a illustrative example.

```{r first_load, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(RITANdata)
library(RITAN)
library(BgeeDB)
```


```{r geneset_overlap1, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.align='center'}
