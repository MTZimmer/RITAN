RITAN indexes multiple resources and choosing which of them are most relevant for your study can be a challenge. To help with this process, we provide below a set of examples from different types of studies and the thinking behind which resources were used.

# Example

```{r first_load, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(RITANdata)
library(RITAN)
```


```{r geneset_overlap1, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.align='center'}
## TO DO
```
