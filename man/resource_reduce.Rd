\title{resource_reduce
Merge terms across resources to reduce the number of redundant and semi-redundant terms}
\usage{
resource_reduce(genesets = NULL, min_overlap = 0.8, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{genesets}{the input genesets to consider. May be from one or multiple resources.}

\item{min_overlap}{terms that share at least this fraction of genes will be merged}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE, print status and summary output}

\item{mutual_overlap}{[TO DO; FEATURE NOT IMPLEMENTED] if TRUE, the overlap must be reciprocal in order to merge}
}
\value{
the list of terms, after merging to reduce redundnat and semi-redundant terms
}
