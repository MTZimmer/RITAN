\title{geneset_overlap
Return assymetric matrix of the fraction of genes shared between sets. E.G. The fraction of the first set that is "covered" by or "overlaps" the second set.}
\usage{
geneset_overlap(s1, s2 = s1, s.size = unlist(lapply(s1, length)))
}
\arguments{
\item{s1}{The first geneset}

\item{s2}{the second geneset}

\item{s.size}{Default is to determint the lengths of "s1" elements}
}
\value{
results matrix of input gene list compared to active gene sets. Q value is calculated using entire group of active gene sets.
