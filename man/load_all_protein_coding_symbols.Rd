\usage{

  load_all_protein_coding_symbols(file = "ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/genenames/new/tsv/locus_groups/protein-coding_gene.txt",
  col_name = "symbol")
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{file name of a table containing gene symbols}

\item{col_name}{column name within "file" that contains symbols}
}
\value{
A unique list of gene symbols from the current protein coding set at the EBI
}
\description{
The character array returned is, by default, all human protein coding gene symbols. This variable defines the "universe of possible genes" for use in enrichment. Users should load a different "universe" or filter this one down to the most appropriate setting for their current study. For example, if running RNA-Seq, genes are in the universie if they are detected in any sample.
